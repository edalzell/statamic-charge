# Charge

Now you can charge your visitors for products, membership, what ever you like, all via Stripe. Both one-time and recurring charges are supported.

Use either the built in `form` tag or Charge's own form tag, whichever is right for you.

Supports both Stripe Checkout and Elements/Stripe.js

Please note, in order to comply with the Secure Customer Authentication regulations, the implementation of Charge has changed. See the [docs](DOCUMENTATION.md) for details.
